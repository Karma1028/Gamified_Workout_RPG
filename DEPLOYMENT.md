## Configuration Required

### 1. Google OAuth Setup

To enable Google sign-in:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
3. Add authorized redirect URI:
   ```
   https://ouxznheawjryawmygikq.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```
4. Configure in Supabase Dashboard:
   - Navigate to: Authentication → Providers → Google
   - Enable Google provider
   - Enter Client ID and Client Secret

### 2. OpenRouter AI (Optional Enhancement)

The app is ready for AI integration. See `OPENROUTER_INTEGRATION.md` for complete setup instructions.

**API Key** (already configured):
```
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
```

**Integration Points**:
- Workout plan generation
- Nutrition plan customization
- Exercise recommendations

### 3. Google Drive Sync (Optional Enhancement)

Drive integration requires additional OAuth scope:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`

Current implementation:
- ✅ CSV export (working)
- ⏳ Direct Drive API sync (requires OAuth scope configuration)

## Database Connection

The app is connected to Supabase:

**URL**: `https://ouxznheawjryawmygikq.supabase.co`

**Tables**:
- `users` - User profiles
- `exercises` - Exercise library (28 exercises)
- `workout_logs` - Workout history
- `skill_unlocks` - Unlocked skills
- `user_stats` - Aggregated statistics
- `onboarding_data` - User preferences
- `plans` - Generated workout plans

## Build Information

**Framework**: React 18.3.1 + TypeScript + Vite 5.4.2
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
**Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
**Build Size**: 333 KB (gzipped: 94.5 KB)
**Build Time**: ~4s
